# Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) System

## Project Overview
This project implements an automated Python system that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on any user-provided CSV dataset. Given a dataset, the system automatically generates dataset summaries, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and human-readable insights without manual intervention.

The goal is to replicate and extend the in-class “getting to know your data” workflow in a fully automated and reproducible way.

## Features
- Automatically loads and inspects any CSV dataset
- Performs data quality checks:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicate rows
  - Constant-value columns
  - High-missingness columns
- Computes descriptive statistics for numeric and categorical variables
- Flags outliers using the 1.5×IQR rule
- Generates at least five visualizations:
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Bar chart
  - Scatter plot
  - Correlation heatmap
- Produces 5–10 human-readable insights based on computed results
- Includes limitations and potential bias notes
- Runs end-to-end with a single function call

## How It Works
The system is organized as a modular pipeline:

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Dataset Overview & Quality Checks**
3. **Descriptive Statistics**
4. **Visualization Generation**
5. **Insight & Limitation Generation**
6. **Combined Automated Report**

All steps are executed automatically once a CSV file is provided.
